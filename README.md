# Python Challenge

Provided are two files, adventure.py and classes.py. Running the adventure.py file `python adventure.py`  will run the Python text adventure game 'Mission to Mars'. 
Extend classes.py to improve the game with whatever you think might make it funner. 

Feel free to re-organize and change whatever you would like to to make it your program. 

Programming Principles to keep in Mind (some of which the current program breaks)

* Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  - if you are writing things multiple times make them into variables or functions to reuse
* You Ain't Gonna Need it (YAGNI)
  - don't write something you aren't using (the Alien class totally breaks this rule currently)
* Keep it simple, silly (KISS) 
  - if your program seems overly complicated it probably is, try and keep it simple.
